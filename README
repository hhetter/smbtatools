How to build from Source
------------------------

smbtatools is using cmake for building. You need to
install cmake on your system.

smbtatools is usually build out-of-source. To do this,
you create a directory where you want to build, and
run cmake $PATH_TO_THE_SMBTATOOLS_SOURCES.

Suppose smbtatools is in /home/user/smbtatools

Then you may run the build like this:
mkdir /home/user/smbtatools-run
cd /home/user/smbtatools-run
cmake ../smbtatools

The build will now report libraries and headers you
require to build....

make

(as root) : make install
