--------------

For each of file sizes, simple copy from/to were carried out 10 times. Average
transfer speed were used. It was all automated using Phoronix Test Suite.

To reproduce these tests, you will require the following:
1) Download and install PTS (http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/)
2) create local profile for specified file size (10MB, 100MB, 1GB etc)
you will require following files (examples attached):
* downloads.xml
* install.sh
* results-definition.xml
* test-definition.xml

3) install and run tests. For convenience, I attached simple script which does
it automatically:
* run_tests.sh

In my test scenario, samba+smbtad were installed on one computer and tests were
carried out from remote machine.
