What is SMB Traffic Analyzer
----------------------------

SMB Traffic Analyzer (from now on called SMBTA) is a software suite utilizing
the Samba CIFS server to create statistics about the data traffic on a Samba
network. SMBTA is made out of several components:

- a module in the VFS (Virtual File System) Layer of Samba
- a system daemon program
- two user oriented programs to visualize the statistics

SMBTA is utilizing a SQL storage to store data about the traffic caused on a
network. By making this data available via SQL, SMBTA is helpful for many
system administrators.

Having knowledge of SQL is not required. The user may also run the client programs
to query the database. These are specialized to the organization of the database,
and are taking away much of the work to translate often needed questions into SQL
statements from the user.

The basic idea and main concept of SMBTA was born on the SambaXP conference
in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany, in 2007. At the SNIA conference 2008, I was able to
present a prototype of the idea to the Samba team. The code for the module
got immediately accepted and was introduced with Samba 3.2.0 to Samba users.
